    <p class="p-about">Hey everyone. My name is Will Chandler and I'm a front-end developer.</p>

    <p class="p-about">A sixth-generation Texan, I've lived in Mexico, Scotland, and Spain. I'm currently based in Austin, with dreams of the Pacific Northwest.</p>

    <p class="p-about">For many years, I went down a liberal arts and social sciences path. I studied Spanish and earned a Masters in international relations. I supervised international academic programs, and managed an interdisciplinary human rights center.</p>

    <p class="p-about">But throughout this journey, I knew that my true calling lay elsewhere. Programming had always intrigued me, and when I finally took the plunge into web development, it was clear that I had found my lifelong career.</p>

    <p class="p-about">I completed a full stack web development bootcamp through UT Austin, and now I'm a UI developer. I am constantly challenged and always learning, and couldn't be happier.</p>
